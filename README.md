## Hi there 👋

I am a forth year PhD. student at IIT Delhi, where I work in the Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2) lead by Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty. My primary area of research includes understanding generalization capabilities of small and efficient language models. I also actively work on designing efficient methods for compressing large language models for adpoting in resource-constrained settings.
